# AliceInFlowerLand
IN PROGRESS - Mock Flower Shop Website Project

Personal project as I am learning web development skills and languages, I will be editing and applying what I've learned to a functional website. The website was inspired by Alice in Wonderland and features a mock flower shop website. I will be posting updates the website as I am able to complete them in my spare time. The website is hand coded in HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Bootstrap so far. As I learn backend technologies I may add  more functionality and components to it as well.
